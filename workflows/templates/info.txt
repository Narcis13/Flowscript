Workflow Templates
==================

This directory contains reusable workflow templates for common patterns.

Templates include:
- Approval workflows (single/multi-level)
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
- Retry patterns with exponential backoff
- Parallel processing workflows
- Notification chains
- Data validation pipelines
- State machine patterns

Templates can be customized by modifying configuration parameters and node settings.
