### Todo Summary
**Total tasks:** 10
**Completed:** 8
**Remaining:** 2

**Completed tasks:**
1. ✅ Read project specifications and implementation plan
2. ✅ Check tasks/todo.md for current development phase
3. ✅ Analyze current frontend implementation
4. ✅ Create refactoring plan for AlpineJS/Bulma frontend
5. ✅ Fix WebSocket timing and race conditions
6. ✅ Implement HITL form rendering with JSON Schema
7. ✅ Add state debugger functionality
8. ✅ Update tasks/todo.md with progress

**Incomplete tasks:**
1. ⏳ Improve error handling and recovery (pending - medium priority)
2. ⏳ Add performance optimizations (pending - low priority)

### Key Accomplishments

1. **WebSocket Race Condition Fix**
   - Created `EnhancedFlowScriptWebSocket` class with pre-subscription support
   - Implemented event buffering to prevent missing events
   - Added subscription confirmation protocol
   - Enhanced connection health monitoring

2. **Complete HITL Implementation**
   - Built dynamic JSON Schema form generator
   - Supports all schema types with validation
   - Created interaction queue management
   - Added timeout tracking and notifications

3. **Comprehensive State Debugger**
   - State history with snapshots
   - Diff comparison between states
   - Tree view and JSON view modes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Path-based filtering

### Features Implemented

**WebSocket Enhancements:**
- Pre-subscription mechanism
- Event buffering per execution
- Subscription confirmation tracking
- Debug buffer for troubleshooting
- Enhanced statistics and monitoring

**HITL Features:**
- Dynamic form generation from JSON Schema
- Support for: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects
- Custom UI widgets (switches, range sliders, textareas)
- Enum/select dropdowns with custom labels
- Required field validation
- Array item management
- Form submission and validation
- Timeout countdown display
- Interaction queue with status tracking

**State Debugger Features:**
- Capture state snapshots manually or automatically
- Navigate through state history
- Compare states with diff visualization
- Filter state by path
- Export/import state snapshots
- Tree view for nested object exploration
- Size tracking for each snapshot

### Problems Encountered and Solutions

1. **User Request Change**: Initially started implementing a React+Vite solution but user requested to keep AlpineJS/Bulma
   - **Solution**: Abandoned React approach and refactored within existing architecture

2. **WebSocket Timing**: Events were being missed due to subscription happening after workflow started
   - **Solution**: Implemented pre-subscription with buffering

3. **Dynamic Form Rendering**: AlpineJS doesn't have built-in schema form support
   - **Solution**: Created custom form generator that outputs HTML with Alpine directives

4. **State Management**: No centralized state management in AlpineJS
   - **Solution**: Leveraged Alpine stores and event-driven updates

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible. The enhanced WebSocket falls back to regular behavior if not available.

### Important Findings

1. **WebSocket Protocol**: The server uses a specific message type system that needed to be matched exactly
2. **AlpineJS Limitations**: Dynamic HTML generation requires x-html directive and careful escaping
3. **Event Timing**: The 100ms delay in ExecutionManager was causing race conditions
4. **Form Binding**: Alpine's x-model works well with dynamically generated forms when properly structured

### Dependencies Added/Removed
**No new dependencies added** - Solution uses only existing libraries:
- AlpineJS 3.13.3 (existing)
- Bulma 0.9.4 (existing)
- Font Awesome 6.5.1 (existing)

### Configuration Changes
None - all changes are in frontend code only

### Deployment Steps
1. Ensure all new JS files are served by static file server
2. Clear browser cache to get latest scripts
3. No backend changes required

### Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Flexibility**: Sometimes the "simple" solution (AlpineJS) is better than the "modern" one (React)
2. **Event-Driven Design**: WebSocket events need careful handling and buffering
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced features should gracefully fall back
4. **Documentation**: The existing codebase had good structure but lacked HITL implementation

### What Wasn't Completed

1. **Error Handling Improvements**: Basic error handling exists but could be more robust
   - Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Better error recovery strategies
   - User-friendly error messages

2. **Performance Optimizations**: 
   - Virtual scrolling for large event logs
   - Pagination for state history
   - WebSocket message batching

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Workflow visualization
   - Execution history persistence
   - Multi-user support

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **WebSocket Debugging**: Use the debug buffer in EnhancedFlowScriptWebSocket for troubleshooting
2. **Form Generation**: The form generator can be extended with more custom widgets by adding cases to generateField()
3. **State Management**: Always update the Alpine store when changing state to keep UI in sync
4. **Event Handling**: Use the enhanced WebSocket's preSubscribe() before starting workflows
5. **Testing HITL**: Use the "Create Test Interaction" button to test without running workflows
6. **CSS Variables**: The theme system uses CSS variables for easy customization
7. **No Build Step**: Remember there's no build process - changes to JS files take effect immediately

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery
2. Add performance optimizations for large datasets
3. Create E2E tests for the refactored components
4. Add workflow visualization using the state debugger data
5. Implement state persistence to survive page reloads
6. Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
7. Create user documentation for the new features
