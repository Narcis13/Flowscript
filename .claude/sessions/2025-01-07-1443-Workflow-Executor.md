## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: January 7, 2025 14:43
- **Focus**: Workflow Executor Implementation (Phase 4)
- **Project**: FlowScript - Declarative workflow system with HITL support

## Goals
*Please specify the goals for this session. Based on the current phase, suggested goals include:*
- [x] Build the core workflow executor (executeFlow function)
- [x] Implement branch structure execution logic
- [x] Implement loop structure execution logic
- [x] Create node execution wrapper with error handling
- [x] Implement expression evaluator for conditions

*Or provide your specific goals for this session.*

## Progress

### Initial Status
- Phase 4: Workflow Executor (0% complete at session start)
- Core types and node system fully implemented
- Ready to implement the execution engine

### Updates
**14:45** - Discovered that Phase 4 has already been completed in previous sessions:
- WorkflowExecutor class fully implemented with:
  - Sequential, branch, and loop execution support
  - Edge-based routing with special edges (exit, loopTo:)
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
  - Event emission for workflow lifecycle
  - Timeout protection
- Node execution wrapper (node-executor.ts) with:
  - Retry logic with configurable attempts
  - Timeout handling
  - Error edge support
  - Node validation utilities
- Comprehensive test suite covering all execution scenarios
- Phase 4 is now 100% complete (19/40 total tasks done)

### Next Steps
The project is ready to move to Phase 5: Human-in-the-Loop implementation

8. ✅ Update todo.md with progress

### Key Accomplishments

This was a discovery session where I found that Phase 4 (Workflow Executor) had already been fully implemented in previous sessions. The implementation is comprehensive and production-ready.

### Features Already Implemented

1. **WorkflowExecutor** (`src/core/executor/WorkflowExecutor.ts`):
   - Complete workflow execution engine
   - Sequential node execution
   - Branch structure execution with condition evaluation
   - Loop structure execution with controller nodes
   - Edge-based routing system
   - Special edge handling (exit, loopTo:)
   - Comprehensive event emission
   - Timeout protection
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Node Executor Utilities** (`src/core/executor/node-executor.ts`):
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Individual node timeouts
   - Error edge support
   - Node result validation
   - Safe node wrappers
   - Logging node decorators

3. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - Complete type system with proper TypeScript types
   - StateManager with JSONPath support
   - RuntimeContext with pause/resume capabilities
   - Node registry system with dynamic loading
   - Expression evaluator for safe condition evaluation
   - Comprehensive test coverage

### Problems Encountered and Solutions

**Problem**: Initial expectation was to implement the workflow executor from scratch.
**Solution**: Discovered through file exploration that the implementation was already complete, saving significant development time.

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings

1. **FlowElement Structure**: The implementation uses explicit type fields (`type: 'branch'` or `type: 'loop'`) rather than array-based detection as originally specified. This provides better TypeScript type safety.

2. **Edge Evaluation**: Edges use lazy evaluation functions that return promises, allowing for async data computation.

3. **Node Execution**: All nodes are executed with a wrapper that provides retry logic, timeout handling, and error recovery.

### Dependencies Added/Removed
None during this session (all dependencies were previously added).

### Configuration Changes
None during this session.

### Deployment Steps Taken
None - development phase only.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always check existing implementation first** - Significant work had already been done in previous sessions.

2. **The codebase is well-structured** - Clear separation of concerns with:
   - Core types in `/types`
   - Execution logic in `/executor`
   - Node implementations in `/nodes`
   - Utilities in `/utils`

3. **Test coverage is comprehensive** - The WorkflowExecutor has thorough tests covering all execution scenarios.

### What Wasn't Completed

Nothing - all Phase 4 tasks were already complete. The session served as a review and documentation exercise.

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **Next Phase**: Focus on Phase 5 (Human-in-the-Loop) which includes:
   - Implementing human node type with form schema support
   - Creating HITL pause/resume mechanism

2. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `/src/core/executor/WorkflowExecutor.ts` - Main execution logic
   - `/src/core/executor/node-executor.ts` - Node execution utilities
   - `/src/core/types/` - All type definitions
   - `/docs/specs.md` - Original specification

3. **Testing**: Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass before making changes.

4. **Architecture Notes**:
   - Nodes communicate through edges, not by specifying next nodes
   - State is managed centrally through StateManager
   - Events are emitted throughout the workflow lifecycle
   - The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous node execution

5. **Development Workflow**:
   - Always update `/tasks/todo.md` when completing tasks
   - Use the session tracking system in `.claude/sessions/`
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage for new features

### Session End
The session successfully reviewed and documented the existing workflow executor implementation. The project is in excellent shape with 47.5% of total tasks completed and ready for the next phase of development.
