# FlowScript Development Session - 2025-07-06 22:57

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: July 6, 2025 22:57
- **Project**: FlowScript - Declarative workflow system with HITL support
- **Current Phase**: Phase 9 (Quality & Tooling) - Remaining tasks

## Goals
- Fix frontend stability issues:
  1. UI not updating on first workflow execution
  2. Event timeline overlapping footer

## Progress

### Frontend Bug Fixes Completed
1. **Fixed WebSocket Event Timing Issue** (workflow.js):
   - Separated event listener setup into `setupWebSocketListeners()` method
   - Added deferred initialization to wait for WebSocket client
   - Ensured event listeners check both component and root execution IDs
   - Added reactive getter for executionId to stay in sync with parent
   - Re-setup listeners after workflow execution starts

2. **Fixed Timeline Overflow Issue** (app.css):
   - Implemented proper flex layout for the entire app structure
   - Set viewport-based max-heights for tab content
   - Reduced timeline box height from 500px to 450px
   - Added z-index layering to keep footer above content
   - Ensured footer has opaque background
   - Added proper margins and spacing
   - Fixed notification container pointer events

3. **Fixed Race Condition** (ExecutionManager.ts, app.js, workflow.js):
   - Increased workflow execution delay from 10ms to 100ms
   - Frontend now subscribes to WebSocket immediately after getting executionId
   - Added 50ms delay in frontend to ensure subscription is processed
   - This prevents the workflow from completing before the WebSocket subscription is established

### Tasks from todo.md to focus on:
- [ ] Implement workflow definition validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for StateManager
- [ ] Create unit tests for node execution
- [ ] Create unit tests for workflow executor
- [ ] Create integration tests for HITL scenarios
- [ ] Create development scripts (build, test, dev server)
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier configuration
- [ ] Create AI hints system for node metadata
- [ ] Add persistence hooks to StateManager

## Notes
- Current progress: 32/41 tasks completed
- Frontend implementation has been completed through Phase 7 (WebSocket manager, workflow executor)
- Recent fixes include node registration, template variable resolution, and workflow loading from filesystem
