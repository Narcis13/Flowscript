## Progress

### Completed Tasks (2025-07-09)

1. **Reviewed existing Google nodes**:

   - email-automation.json: Batch process emails based on search criteria

4. **Updated project files**:
   - Registered all new nodes in registerAll.ts
   - Updated todo.md with implementation progress
   - All nodes follow consistent patterns with proper error handling

### Summary
Successfully implemented 6 new Gmail action nodes, bringing the total custom Google nodes to 8. All nodes integrate with the existing OAuth2 authentication flow and use consistent error handling patterns. Created comprehensive example workflows demonstrating real-world use cases.
