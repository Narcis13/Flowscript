# Frontend Stability Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. UI Not Updating on First Workflow Execution

**Problem**: When executing a workflow for the first time after page load, the UI would remain in "workflow started" state and not show real-time updates from the WebSocket events.

**Root Cause**: The `workflowExecutor` component was setting up WebSocket event listeners in its `init()` method, but the WebSocket client wasn't always ready at component initialization time. The event listeners were only set up once, so if the WebSocket wasn't connected, the component would never receive workflow events.

**Solution** (in `public/js/workflow.js`):
- Created a separate `setupWebSocketListeners()` method that can be called multiple times
- Added a deferred initialization check that waits for the WebSocket client to be available
- Re-setup listeners after starting a workflow execution to ensure they're active
- Made the component check both its local `executionId` and the parent's `$root.executionId`
- Added a reactive getter for `executionId` to ensure it stays synchronized

### 2. Event Timeline Overlapping Footer

**Problem**: When many events were displayed in the execution timeline, they would overflow and appear on top of the footer, making the interface unusable.

**Root Cause**: The CSS layout wasn't properly constraining the timeline container, and the footer didn't have proper z-index layering to stay above scrollable content.

**Solution** (in `public/css/app.css`):
- Implemented proper flexbox layout for the entire application structure
- Set viewport-based max-heights for tab content areas
- Reduced timeline container heights to leave room for the footer
- Added z-index: 40 to the footer to ensure it stays above content
- Ensured the footer has an opaque background in both light and dark modes
- Added proper margins and padding to prevent content from getting too close to the footer
- Fixed notification container pointer-events to prevent click interference

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test First Execution**:
   - Navigate to localhost:3013
   - Select a workflow
   - Execute it and verify the timeline updates in real-time
   - Events should appear immediately as nodes execute

2. **Test Timeline Overflow**:
   - Execute a workflow with many nodes (e.g., document-processing)
   - Verify the timeline scrolls within its container
   - Confirm the footer remains visible and clickable
   - Check that the last events are not hidden behind the footer

3. **Test Dark Mode**:
   - Toggle dark mode (Ctrl+/)
   - Verify the footer background remains opaque
   - Check that all overflow behaviors work correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very long timelines
2. Add pagination or filtering for execution events
3. Implement collapsible timeline items for better space usage
4. Add a "scroll to bottom" button for the timeline
