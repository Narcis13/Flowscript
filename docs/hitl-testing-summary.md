# HITL Testing Summary

## Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing solution for FlowScript without requiring a web UI or WebSocket client.

### What Was Created

1. **Interactive CLI Command (`run-interactive`)**
   - Monitors workflow execution for human interaction events
   - Converts JSON Schema forms to interactive CLI prompts using Inquirer.js
   - Shows real-time workflow progress
   - Handles user input, cancellations, and timeouts

2. **Test Workflows**
   - `guess-number-game.json` - Interactive number guessing game with loops and conditionals
   - `simple-hitl-test.json` - Basic form collection demonstrating various input types
   - Custom game logic nodes (initializeGame, checkGuess, displayResults)

3. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Schema-to-prompt conversion utilities
   - Template substitution for dynamic content
   - Context data formatting
   - Comprehensive documentation

### How to Use

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run an interactive workflow
flowscript run-interactive workflows/test/simple-hitl-test.json

# Run the guess number game
flowscript run-interactive workflows/test/guess-number-game.json
```

### Example Output

When you run an interactive workflow, you'll see:

```
üöÄ Running workflow interactively: simple-hitl-test
   Interactive mode enabled - will prompt for human interactions

üèÅ Workflow started

‚öôÔ∏è  Executing: formInput

ü§ö Human interaction required:
   Node: formInput
   Context:
      userName: null
      favoriteColor: null
      age: null
      summary: null

üìã Welcome to FlowScript!
   Let's test the interactive features. Please provide some information:

? What should we call you? ‚ñà
```

The CLI will prompt for each field in the form schema, validate inputs, and continue the workflow with your responses.

### Technical Details

- **Event System**: Listens for `human:input:required` events from the workflow executor
- **Resume Mechanism**: Uses the RuntimeContext's pause/resume functionality
- **Form Rendering**: Converts JSON Schema to Inquirer.js questions with proper validation
- **Template Support**: Dynamic content in prompts using `{{state.variable}}` syntax

### Testing Without Interaction

For automated testing, you can:
1. Use the mock approach shown in `test-debug.js`
2. Create unit tests that simulate human responses
3. Use the REST API when the server is running

### Limitations

- Inquirer.js requires TTY for interactive prompts (can't pipe input easily)
- Complex UI elements (file uploads, rich text) aren't supported in CLI
- Multi-user interactions require the full API/WebSocket setup

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully allows testing of HITL workflows through a command-line interface, making it ideal for development, debugging, and demonstrating workflow functionality without needing a full web UI.
